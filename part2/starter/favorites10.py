# favorites10.py
# Task: Ask the user for a problem name, then count how many students
#       listed it as their favourite — using a parameterised SQL query.
#
# CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:
#   Never build SQL strings with f-strings or string concatenation.
#   Always use ? placeholders. The library substitutes safely.
#
#   WRONG:  db.execute(f"SELECT ... WHERE problem = '{favorite}'")
#   RIGHT:  db.execute("SELECT ... WHERE problem = ?", favorite)
#
# Sample run:
#   Favorite: Speller
#   10
